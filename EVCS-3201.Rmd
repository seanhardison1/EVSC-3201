# Introduction {-}

In light of the extenuating circumstances regarding COVID-19, I've decided to experiment with a new format for teaching the Fundamental of Ecology Lab. For the rest of the semester, I'll add instructions, notes, and videos to tabs on this site. The goal of these materials is to supplement the lab manual by providing some interactivity that we're missing out on by not meeting face-to-face. Assignments due each week will be added to the bottom of each page.

# Forest Lab Data Analysis: Results 

See below for results from the forest lab field study. When answering the questions on page 27 of your lab manual, make sure your interpretations align with what's shown here. 

## Processing and analytical code

**Important**: This code must be evaluated prior to running any other code in this document. Note that I used `read_excel` to read in data directly from where it is located on my computer. To reproduce these analyses you will need to alter those lines to match where the data is located on your own computer.

```{r, message = F, warning = F}
# read in libraries
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)


#read in data - change these lines to reflect where the data are stored on your computer
env = read_excel("/users/seanhardison/desktop/ecology lab/environmental_data.xlsx")
forest = read_excel("/users/seanhardison/desktop/ecology lab/forest_lab.xlsx")

#summarise data
summary_env = env %>% 
  
  #create new column for slope angle
  mutate(slope_angle = atan(Rise/Run) * 180/pi) %>% 
  
  #Tell R to group by Site for finding mean and standard deviation
  group_by(Site) %>% 
  
  #Find the mean and standard deviation by site
  summarise(mean_slope_angle = mean(slope_angle, na.rm = T),
            sd_slope_angle = sd(slope_angle, na.rm = T),
            
            mean_thickness = mean(`Horizon Thickness`),
            sd_thickness = sd(`Horizon Thickness`),
            
            mean_moisture = mean(`Soil Moisture`),
            sd_moisture = sd(`Soil Moisture`),
            
            mean_temperature = mean(`Soil Temperature`),
            sd_temperature = sd(`Soil Temperature`))
```

                    ymax = mean_slope_angle + sd_slope_angle),

                            "soil moisture ~ slope angle"),
           slope = c(round(coef(temp_moisture_mod)[2], 3),
                              round(coef(moist_hor_thickness_mod)[2], 3),

knitr::kable(model_summaries,  "markdown",align=rep('c', 3))
```

## Tree community composition 

In order to better visualize individual species, I added a line specifying a new color palette: `... + scale_fill_manual(values = as.vector(pals::polychrome(35)))`. 

### Species relative frequency {-}

```{r}
# Data processing
rel_freq = forest %>% 
  
  # Select columns we want to plot
  select(Site, `Relative Frequency`, `Tree ID`) %>% 
  
  # Get distinct values of each row
  distinct()

# Plot the data
ggplot(data = rel_freq) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = Site, y = `Relative Frequency`,
               fill = `Tree ID`), stat = "identity") +
  
  #add color palette 
  scale_fill_manual(values = as.vector(pals::polychrome(35)))+
  theme_bw()
```

### Species relative dominance {-}

```{r}
# Data processing
rel_dom = forest %>% 
  
  # Select columns we want to plot
  select(Site, `Relative Dominance`, `Tree ID`) %>% 
  
  # Get distinct values of each row
  distinct()

# Plot the data
ggplot(data = rel_dom) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = Site, y = `Relative Dominance`,
               fill = `Tree ID`), stat = "identity") +
  
  #add color palette 
  scale_fill_manual(values = as.vector(pals::polychrome(35)))+
  theme_bw()
```

### Species importance {-}

```{r}
# Data processing

  # Select columns we want to plot
  select(Site, Importance, `Tree ID`) %>% 
  
  # Get distinct values of each row

# Stream Lab (week of 3/27)

## Supplemental videos

### Stream stressors: impervious surfaces {-}

```{r, echo = F}
knitr::include_url("https://www.youtube.com/embed/wZGzqDfoIks")
```

### Stream restoration in Baltimore County {-}

```{r, echo = F}
knitr::include_url("https://www.youtube.com/embed/jIGoCM2sCBM")
```

### Stream characteristics: pools and riffles {-}

```{r, echo = F}
knitr::include_url("https://www.youtube.com/embed/RGM1X6rcWEE")
```

## Discussion questions 

Video 1. Scientists from the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center use biodiversity assessments to quantify the health of stream habitats. How would you expect an increase in nearby impervious surfaces to affect the **abundance** and **biodiversity** of stream macroinvertebrates? Why?

Video 2. In Northern Virginia, rapid development has led to increased run-off and subsequent stream erosion. According to the video about Baltimore County stream restoration, what are two methods that are used to restore streams in developed areas?

Video 3. Pool and riffle sequences are characterized by unique flow characteristics. After reading pages 29-35 in the lab manual and watching the video on pools and riffles, would you expect biodiversity and abundance to be higher in pools or in riffles? Why? 

## Assignments 

Assignments are due on <s>March 29th</s> March 27th by 2 pm.

1. Use this week's reading (pages 29-35 in your lab manual) and the embedded videos to answer the discussion questions listed above. Submit in a word document.

2. Don't forget that forest lab questions and abstract are also due!

3. The stream lab involves calculating Simpson's diversity index (D) (lab manual pg. 36) and species [rank abundance curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rank_abundance_curve). Download the file `dinosaur_example.xlsx` from collab, and see if you can calculate D and rank abundance from the given abundance data "sampled" at Site A and Site B. Give it a shot over next week and we will finish/discuss it in class.

Here's the Excel calculation for **Site A**:

## Hypothesis testing

The goal of the text and figures below is to describe the *t* test in a visually intuitive way, and was mostly derived from @zar1984. Further information and another example are provided in your lab manuals on page 36. 

**Hypothesis testing** is all about drawing inferences about a broader *population* given a *representative sample*. A common approach to hypothesis testing involves comparing the means of two samples. For example, consider an experiment where nitrogen fertilizer was added to the soils of 40 randomly selected plants, with 40 other plants not recieving the nutrient treatment. The heights of each plant were measured after two weeks. The results of the experiment are shown in Figure 4.1.

In this experiment, our null hypothesis ($H_0$) is that there is no difference in mean height between the plants recieving nutrient and no-nutrient treatments. We can test this hypothesis using a two sample *t* test, which is designed to infer differences in two populations being sampled. 

```{r compare, echo = F, fig.cap = "Histograms showing the heights of two groups of plants after two weeks of growth. The orange histogram reflects those plants that recieved a nitrogen treatment and the purple histogram shows the plants that did not.", message = F}
set.seed(14)
df <- tibble(c1 = rnorm(40) + 10,
                t1 = rnorm(40) + 13)
label_df <- tibble(label = c("Mean height of control (no nitrogen)",
                             "Mean height of treatment (nitrogen added)"),
                   x = c(mean(df$c1),
                         mean(df$t1)),
                   y = c(9, 9))
ggplot(data = df) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = c1), 
                 fill = "purple", alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = t1), 
                 fill = "orange", alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = mean(c1), xend = mean(c1),
                   y = 0, yend = 8.5), color = "grey50") +
  geom_segment(aes(x = mean(t1), xend = mean(t1),
                   y = 0, yend = 8.5), color = "grey50") +
  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(data = label_df, aes(x = x, 
                                                 y = y,
                                                 label = label),
                           force = T,
                           nudge_x = c(-0.05, 0.2)) +
  ylab("Frequency of occurrence") +
  xlab("Plant height (cm)") +
  theme_bw()
```

### The *t* statistic

Before we jump into the two-sample *t* test, let's explore some concepts.

First consider the mean height of the no nitrogen sample: `r round(mean(df$c1), 1)` cm. Next, say we found a value in the literature suggesting that the mean height of all plants of this species was 10 cm. Is the mean of this sample significantly different from the established value?

This leaves us with the null hypothesis $(H_0)$ that there is no difference between the population mean $(\mu)$ of 10 cm and our sample mean $(\bar{X})$ of `r round(mean(df$c1), 1)` cm $(H_0: \mu = \bar{X})$. To test this hypothesis, we start with the idea that the mean of our sample is only one of many possible means from samples of size 40 that could have been drawn at random from the population. Given the population mean of 10 cm $(\mu = 10\;\textrm{cm})$, we can estimate how unlikely our sample mean is by calculating a *t* statistic:

$$t = \frac{\bar{X}-\mu}{s_{\bar{X}}} ,$$

where $\bar{X}$ is the sample mean, $\mu$ is hypothesized population mean, and $s_{\bar{X}}$ is the standard deviation of the sample. If our sample mean also equals 10, then $t = 0$. If we resampled the population a thousand more times, calculated the *t* statistic for each sample mean, and plotted the histogram of all *t* statistics, the shape of the histogram would resemble the line in Figure 4.2.

```{r, fig.cap = "The *t* distribution, describing all possible sample means for n = 40. This *t* distribution is a *probability distribution*.", echo = F}
df2 <- tibble(x = seq(-4, 4, length=1000),
              y = dt(seq(-4, 4, length=1000), 39))
us <- tibble(x = c(mean(df$c1) - 10, mean(df2$x)),
             y = c(df2[round(df2$x, 2) == 0.34,]$y , max(df2$y)),
             label = c("<i>t</i> given a sample mean of 10.3", 
                       "<i>t</i> given a sample mean of 10 (sample mean = hypothesized population mean)"),
             hjust = c(-0.1,1.1),
             vjust = c(0.2,1))
ggplot(df2) +
  geom_line(aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point(data = us, aes(x = x, y = y), color = "red", size = 2) +
  geom_textbox(data = us, aes(x = x, y = y, hjust = hjust, vjust = vjust,
                                           label = label)) +
  theme_bw() +
  ylab("Probability") +
  xlab("The t distribution, describing all possible sample means for n = 40 ")
```

Figure 4.2 describes the distribution of all possible mean values for a given sample size, which is known as the *t* distribution. The shape of the distribution changes according to the **degrees of freedom $(v)$**, which is equal to $n - 1$. Therefore, our sample has $40-1 = 39$ degrees of freedom. As sample size increases, the "tails" of the distribution shrink (Fig. 4.3), reflecting a greater probability of capturing the population mean in your sample. 

```{r, echo = F, fig.cap = 'The *t* distribution with a range of degrees of freedom $(v)$. Note how the "tails" become larger when $v$ is small.'}
df3 <- tibble(x = rep(seq(-4, 4, length=100), 3),
       y = c(dt(seq(-4, 4, length=100), 3),
             dt(seq(-4, 4, length=100), 10),
             dt(seq(-4, 4, length=100), 30)),
      Var = rep(c("v = 3",
              "v = 10",
              "v = 30"), each = 100))
df3$Var <- factor(df3$Var, c("v = 3", "v = 10", "v = 30"))
ggplot(data = df3) +
  geom_line(aes(x = x, y = y, color = Var)) +
  xlab("t") +
  ylab("probability")  +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.title  = element_blank())
```

Some sample means are more likely than others. In this example, given the null hypothesis of the population mean being equal to 10 $(H_0: \mu = 10)$, the probability of a sample mean being less than 7.6 cm is less than 2.5%, and the probability of a sample mean being greater than 12.4 cm is less than 2.5%. Therefore, the probability of a sample mean as extreme or more extreme than either value is less than 5%, or 0.05 (Fig. 4.4). 

```{r, fig.cap = "The *t* distribution is centered around *t* = 0. However, we can contextualize the distribution within our example by adding the hypothesized population mean to *t* $(t + 10\\;\\textrm{cm})$.", echo = F}
us <- tibble(x = c(7.6, 12.4, mean(df2$x) + 10),
             y = c(0.0253, 0.0253, max(df2$y)),
             label = c("Low probability of occurrence (<0.025)",
                       "Low probability of occurrence (<0.025)",
                       "Most likely to occur"))
df4 <- df2 %>% mutate(x = x + 10)
ggplot(df4) +
  geom_line(aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point(data = us, aes(x = x, y = y), color = "red", size = 2) +
  ggrepel::geom_label_repel(data = us, aes(x = x, 
                                           y = y, 
                                           label = label),
                            # nudge_x = 0.1,
                            nudge_y = c(0.075,0.075,-0.025)) +
  theme_bw() +
  ylab("Probability") +
  xlab("The t distribution scaled to our experiment (t + 10 cm)")
```

### The two-sample *t* test

It turns out that if two populations have equal variances (the "spread" of the data) and are normally distributed, then the ratio of the difference in means $(\bar{X_1} - \bar{X_2})$ to the standard error of the difference between the sample means $(s_{\bar{X_1} - \bar{X_2}})$ is *t* distributed. 

The *t* statistic for a two-sample *t* test:

$$t = \frac{\bar{X_1} - \bar{X_2}}{s_{\bar{X_1} - \bar{X_2}}}$$

Therefore, when the above *t* statistic is large, it becomes unlikely that two samples were drawn from the same population, and it follows that each *t* statistic is associated with a probability ($P$), just like in our previous example. If $P$ < 0.05, then we can reject the null hypothesis of no difference between the means of our two samples.

This P value is equivalent to the probability of the *t* statistic occurring by chance alone upon repeated sampling given that the null hypothesis is true. When we reject a null hypothesis based on P < 0.05 using a two-sample *t* test, it means that the probability of seeing differences as larger or larger than what we identified is less than 5% if the samples were drawn from the same population. 

### *t* tests in R and Excel

#### R

Here I'll implement the two-sample *t* test as described above for the plant-nutrient example. In R, two-sample *t* tests are straightforward once the data are in the correct format.

df <- read.csv(file = "/users/seanhardison/documents/git/EVSC-3201/data/nutrient_example.csv")

# view the first ten rows of data. 
head(df)

# do the t test comparing means between nutrient treatments
t.test(df$no_nitrogen, df$nitrogen_added)
```

The results show that $t = -12.79$ and $P < 0.0001$. Therefore, we can reject the null hypothesis that there was no effect of nitrogen treatment, lending support to the alternative hypothesis that nitrogen is beneficial for plant growth.

#### Excel

The process in Excel is just as quick and easy as in R.

1. Once your spreadsheet is open, select the **Data Analysis** tab
2. Next, select **t-Test: Two-Sample Assuming Equal Variances**
3. Select **Variable 1 Range** and highlight the first column you want to compare
4. Select **Variable 2 Range** and highlight the second column you want to compare
5. Select **OK**

```{r, echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("images/t_test_example.gif")
```

### What do I report?

When referring to a *t* test in the text, you should report the *t* statistic, degrees of freedom, and P value.

When presenting results of a *t* test, refer to Table 2 on page 39 of your lab manual.

### Assignments
